\section{Summary and Conclusions}

This work focused on the coupled cluster method and its extension to open-shell nuclei.  After a full treatment of the nuclear problem, with the inclusion of three-body forces and center-of-mass factorization, these CC solutions were used to construct effective Gamow-Teller and Fermi operators for beta decays.  Most calculations centered on closed-shell oxygen isotopes and their particle-attached and particle-removed neighbors.

While this work demonstrated many qualitative features of the various quantities, it suffered from several shortcomings that can be remedied in the future.  First, a lack of sufficient computing resources restricted the model space to a relatively small size such that the results never fully converged.  Additionally, time constraints hindered a full exploration of all the available interactions and model-space parameters.
