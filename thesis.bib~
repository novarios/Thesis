  abstract={Nuclear Astrophysics is concerned with the study of nuclear processes at stellar temperature and density conditions. A main goal is the understanding of the synthesis of the elements and the generation of energy guiding stellar evolution and driving stellar explosions. Observables (like e.g. luminosity curves or elemental abundance distributions) witness the interplay between nuclear structure aspects near the particle drip-lines and the appropriate astrophysical environments, and give guidance to and constraints on stellar conditions and the associated nucleosynthesis. We present an overview of the broad range of nucleosynthesis scenarios from the Big Bang to the different conditions during stellar evolution and stellar explosion. Special emphasis is given to the discussion of nuclear physics aspects of pre-supernova collapse and supernova shock front nucleosynthesis. Of great interests are presently nucleosynthesis processes far from the limits of stability like the neutron diriven r -process and the hydrogen driven rp -process. The nuclear physics of the r -process and the possible site for the r -process in the neutrino driven wind of the supernova shock are discussed and the possible impact of neutrino induced processes is presented. Hydrogen induced explosive processes occur in the thermonuclear runaway on the surface of accreting compact stars at electron degenerate conditions. This includes novae triggered by accretion on white dwarfs and x-ray bursts initiated by accretion on neutron stars. High accretion rates on white dwarfs and neutron stars lead to supernova type Ia explosions or to x-ray pulsars respectively. An overview of the nucleosynthesis conditions and uncertainties is given for all of these scenarios.}

  abstract={The description of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the realistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-, three- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the quantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound and continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab initio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from QCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory. After a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches—built upon the no-core shell model—that are capable of simultaneously describing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for resonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion research. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the 6 He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation of the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of 9 Be. Further, we discuss applications to the 7 Be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1402-4896/91/5/053002/psaa1895ieqn1.gif] {${({\rm{p}},\gamma )}^{8}{\rm{B}}$} radiative capture. Finally, we highlight our efforts to describe transfer reactions including the 3 H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1402-4896/91/5/053002/psaa1895ieqn2.gif] {${({\rm{d}},{\rm{n}})}^{4}$} He fusion.}

  abstract={The value of the V ud matrix element of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix can be derived from nuclear superallowed beta decays, neutron decay and pion beta decay. We survey current world data for all three. Today, the most precise value of V ud comes from the nuclear decays; however, the precision is limited not by experimental error but by the estimated uncertainty in theoretical corrections. Experimental uncertainty does limit the neutron-decay result, which, though statistically consistent with the nuclear result, is approximately a factor of three poorer in precision. The value obtained for V ud leads to a result that differs at the 98$\%$ confidence level from the unitarity condition for the CKM matrix. We examine the reliability of the small calculated corrections that have been applied to the data, and assess the likelihood of even higher quality nuclear data becoming available to confirm or deny the discrepancy. Some of the required experiments depend upon the availability of intense radioactive beams. Others are possible today.}

Detailed comparison between the experimental and theoretical results would establish benchmarks needed for verification and/or parameter adjustment of the nuclear models.
